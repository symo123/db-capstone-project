Little Lemon need you to help them set up a booking system to keep track of which guests are visiting the restaurant and at what times. In this first stage of the task, you need to:

- Set up a repository, or local directory to house your code.
    
- Record all changes made within the system as theyâ€™re implemented.
    
- And allow others to view, review and add to your code.
    

You can carry out these steps using your knowledge of version control and online collaboration. Review the instructions that follow for guidance on completing these tasks.
